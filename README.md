# Sec-Tools
Sec-Tools is a script created in python that allows you to install cybersecurity tools more quickly on other systems (Ubuntu etc...)

All in all, the script is still under development. It is possible that I add tools or I create a second page for windows users or to add several scripts

Here is the preview of the script:

⚠️Attention⚠️ I would not tolerate that someone has skid my script. I would obviously like you not to copy-paste my script and change the author names. Thanks very much.
